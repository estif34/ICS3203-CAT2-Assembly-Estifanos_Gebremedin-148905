# Task 1: Control Flow and Conditional Logic

This assembly program checks whether a number entered by the user is positive, negative, or zero. The program reads input from the user, converts it to an integer, and then displays the appropriate message based on the value of the number.

### Program Overview

#### Purpose:
- The program prompts the user to enter a number.
- It reads the number from the input, converts it to an integer, and compares it to zero.
- Depending on the result of the comparison, the program will print one of the following:
  - "The number is POSITIVE."
  - "The number is NEGATIVE."
  - "The number is ZERO."
- The program then exits.

#### Sections of the Program:
- **.data Section**: Contains constant data such as the prompt message and the strings for "POSITIVE", "NEGATIVE", and "ZERO".
- **.bss Section**: Reserves space for uninitialized data (in this case, the input number).
- **.text Section**: Contains the logic to interact with the user, process the input, and display the result.

#### Key System Calls:
- **sys_write (rax = 1)**: Used to print messages to standard output.
- **sys_read (rax = 0)**: Used to read input from the user.
- **sys_exit (rax = 60)**: Used to terminate the program.

#### Core Logic:
1. The program begins execution at the `_start` label.
2. It writes the prompt message asking the user to input a number.
3. It reads the user input and passes it to the `string_to_int` function to convert the string into an integer.
4. The integer is compared with zero:
   - If the number is positive, it jumps to the `is_positive` section and prints "The number is POSITIVE."
   - If the number is negative, it jumps to the `is_negative` section and prints "The number is NEGATIVE."
   - If the number is zero, it jumps to the `is_zero` section and prints "The number is ZERO."
5. The program terminates using the `sys_exit` system call.
##### Impact of each jump instruction
The program uses several jump instructions to control the flow based on the value of the input:
`cmp rbx, 0`: Compares the value in rbx (the integer value) with zero. This sets the processor's flags for subsequent jump instructions.
`je is_zero`: The je (jump if equal) instruction checks if the number is equal to zero. If true, it jumps to the is_zero label and prints "The number is ZERO." Ensures that when the number is zero, the program prints the correct message and exits.
`jl is_negative`: The jl (jump if less) instruction checks if the number is negative (i.e., less than zero). If true, it jumps to the is_negative label and prints "The number is NEGATIVE." Ensures that when the number is negative, the program prints the correct message and exits.
`jmp is_positive`: The jmp instruction is used here to unconditionally jump to the is_positive label. This happens if the number is positive (greater than zero), and the program prints "The number is POSITIVE." Ensures that when the number is positive, the program prints the correct message and exits.


### Compiling and Running the Program

To compile and run this program, follow these steps:

1. **Save the Code**:
   Save the assembly code in a file named `task1.asm`.

2. **Assemble and Link**:
   - Use `nasm` to assemble the code:
     ```bash
     nasm -f elf64 -o task1.asm task1.o
     ```
   - Use `ld` to link the object file and create the executable:
     ```bash
     ld task1.o -o task1
     ```

3. **Run the Program**:
   - Execute the program with:
     ```bash
     ./task1
     ```
   - The program will display the prompt, and you can enter a number. It will then print whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.

4. **Example Run**:
   ```bash
   Enter a number: 5
   The number is POSITIVE.
### Challenges
String to Integer Conversion: Converting the input string to an integer manually in assembly is complex. Each character in the string must be processed and converted from its ASCII representation to a numeric value, which was done using the `string_to_int` function.

# Task 2: Array Manipulation with Looping and Reversal
### Purpose:
1. Accept 5 integers as input from the user, entered as single-digit space-separated values.
   - The program first prints a prompt message to the user asking for 5 integers to be entered.
   - The program reads one character at a time from the input. Each character is processed and stored as a single integer, but only one digit can be entered per integer (i.e., the program currently cannot handle multi-digit numbers).
   - The characters entered by the user (representing the digits 0â€“9) are converted from their ASCII values into integers. Each integer is stored in an array (which is reserved in memory).
   - This array stores exactly 5 integers, each taking up 4 bytes (the size of a DWORD).
3. Reverse the order of the integers stored in an array.
   - It swaps the elements at the first and last positions, then the second and second-to-last positions, and so on, until the array is reversed.
   - ```asm
     reverse_loop:
       cmp esi, edi            ; Check if start index (esi) >= end index (edi)
       jge print_results       ; If indices have crossed, jump to print_results

      ; Swap elements at indices esi and edi
      mov eax, [array + esi*4]     ; Load the element at start index into eax
      mov ebx, [array + edi*4]     ; Load the element at end index into ebx
      mov [array + esi*4], ebx     ; Store the element from end index at the start index
      mov [array + edi*4], eax     ; Store the element from start index at the end index
      
      inc esi                      ; Increment start index
      dec edi                      ; Decrement end index
      jmp reverse_loop             ; Repeat the loop

4. Print the reversed array to the console.

   
### Compiling and Running the Program

To compile and run this program, follow these steps:

1. **Save the Code**:
   Save the assembly code in a file named `task2.asm`.

2. **Assemble and Link**:
   - Use `nasm` to assemble the code:
     ```bash
     nasm -f elf64 -o task2.asm task2.o
     ```
   - Use `ld` to link the object file and create the executable:
     ```bash
     ld task2.o -o task2
     ```

3. **Run the Program**:
   - Execute the program with:
     ```bash
     ./task2
     ```
4. 4. **Example Run**:
   ```bash
     Enter 5 integers (space-separated):1 2 3 2 1
     Reversed array: 1 2 3 2 1
### Challenges
- Ensuring that the loop correctly terminates when the start pointer (esi) meets or exceeds the end pointer (edi) is crucial to prevent out-of-bounds memory access or unnecessary swaps.
  This step involves direct manipulation of the array's elements in memory, which requires precise handling of register contents to avoid corrupting data.


# Task 3: Modular Program with Subroutines for Factorial Calculation
### Purpose:
The purpose of this program is to compute the factorial of a number between 0 and 9 input by the user. It prompts the user for a number, calculates the factorial of that number, and then prints the result.

### Overview
1. Prompting the User: The program starts by printing the prompt message "Enter a number (0-9):" using the int 0x80 system call for output (syscall number 4).

2. Reading the Input: After displaying the prompt, the program reads the user's input (a single digit number) using the int 0x80 system call (syscall number 3 for input). The input is stored as a string in the input buffer.

3. Converting the Input: The program converts the character input (which is ASCII) to its corresponding integer value by subtracting the ASCII value of '0' (sub eax, '0'). This result is stored in the eax register.

4. Factorial Calculation:

  - The program initializes the result to 1 in the result variable (mov dword [result], 1).
  - It checks if the input number is less than or equal to 1. If so, it skips the multiplication loop.
  - The program then enters a loop (factorial_loop) where it multiplies the current result by the current number (mul ebx) and stores the updated result back in result.
  - It then decrements the number (dec ebx) and continues looping until the number is 1 or less.

5. Displaying the Result:
    Once the factorial is computed, the program prints "Factorial is: " using the int 0x80 syscall (syscall number 4).
    It then calls print_number to print the result (the factorial) as a string by converting it from its numeric form into an ASCII representation.
    Exiting the Program: After printing the result, the program exits by calling int 0x80 with eax set to 1 (syscall number for exit) and ebx set to 0 (exit code).
#### Register Management

### Compiling and Running the Program

To compile and run this program, follow these steps:

1. **Save the Code**:
   Save the assembly code in a file named `task3.asm`.

2. **Assemble and Link**:
   - Use `nasm` to assemble the code:
     ```bash
     nasm -f elf32 task3.asm -o task3.o
     ```
   - Use `ld` to link the object file and create the executable:
     ```bash
     ld -m elf_i386 -o task3 task3.o
     ```

3. **Run the Program**:
   - Execute the program with:
     ```bash
     ./task3
     ```
4. **Example Run**:
   ```bash
   Enter a number (0-9):4
   Factorial is: 24

  ### Challenges
  Factorial Logic: Writing the loop for factorial calculation required managing the decrementing of the input number (stored in ebx) and multiplying the current result. Using the mul instruction was straightforward, but understanding      how to preserve the value of the result while updating it within the loop was important.
  Register Management: ensuring that values are preserved (e.g., by using the stack for saving states when needed) or manipulated directly in registers (like eax for input and result) was key to keeping the program functioning  
  efficiently.
